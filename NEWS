New in 0.5.1
------------

Plausible_values can now work with covariates. Fit_enorm can optionally 
take fixed_parameters into account. 

Significant speed increases in profile_plot, iTIA and iModels and minor 
speed increases in other functions.

Further includes more user control over plotting parameters, 
updates to documentation, several bugfixes and some smaller updates.


New in 0.4.4
------------
Included Rdpack in Imports at the request of CRAN, and fixed 4 minor bugs

New in 0.4.2
------------

We go straight from version 0.1.7 to version 0.4.2 in a major new release.
The functionality envisaged for two other related packages, enorm and 
roger, has now been all incorporated into dexter.

The database has been completely rewritten. Databases created with 0.1.7
can be imported but are no longer maintained.

Many functions now support flexible subsetting of data through a predicate
expression; furthermore, the data source can be either the dexter database
(more usual), or a data frame or tibble. The latter can be useful in 
simple simulations or in some non-standard situations.

Basic test and item analysis has been extended with two interactive tools
based on shiny, and with an exploratory tool to search for DIF. 

Version 0.4.2 estimates the Extended NOminal Response Model (ENORM) by
either CML or a Gibbs sampler, computes person scores by either MLE, EAP,
or plausible values, and provides a new test for the hypothesis of no true
individual differences. In addition, it supports a method for standard
settings known as 3DC. 

Several vignettes have been added to explain the new features in detail.
