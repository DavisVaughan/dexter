Back in February 2018, we [wrote](2018-02-09-dexter-is-1) about the first birthday of **dexter**. Our little dear has now reached yet another stage of maturity: **dexter 1.0.0** is available on CRAN. A new version of **dextergui** to match is on its way.

There are no dramatic changes or additions, but the whole package has been revised, and all non-R parts rewritten in C++ for improved consistency and yet more speed! And even the remotest corners have been cleaned by the new maintainer, Jesse Koops, in the most ~~obsessive~~ thorough way. Same package, totally new experience.
