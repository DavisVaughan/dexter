Just a few lines to boast that (i) __dexter__ has been downloaded in 140 countries now, and (ii) that I have learned how to make nice maps with `tmap` and `leaflet`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RSQLite)
library(sf)
library(spData)
library(tmap)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(htmltools)
library(leaflet)

db = dbConnect(SQLite(), '/Rdatasets/cranlogs.db')
x='dexter'
qu = paste('select iso_a2, count(*) as Downloads from',x,'group by iso_a2')
tab = dbGetQuery(db, qu)
wp = merge(world, tab, all.x=TRUE)
wp = subset(wp, !(iso_a2=='AQ'))
m = tm_shape(wp) + 
    tm_polygons(col = "Downloads", style = "log10", palette = 'Oranges', id='name_long')
tmap_leaflet(m) %>%
    addTiles()
```
